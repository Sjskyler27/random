    <p>Dune – The Dice Game (a.k.a. The Dice Must Flow)
        Clarifications and FAQ
        Collected from BGG Forum Answers
        Version 1.0 – March 8, 2015
        Background
        <p><br></p>1)	As a point of interest, the designer has stated that the game takes place at the start of the first book.  The Emperor has given Arrakis to House Atreides, House Harkonnen does not agree to leave, a fight for the planet starts and all of a sudden everybody is “all in”.  The Fremen have not yet found their Messiah, and would rather tend to “sit it out”, making them a bit slower in recruitment without the incitement of an ally (explaining Fremen’s recruitment penalty.)
        <p><br></p>2)	Regarding the selection of faction colors, from the designer:  Leto I Atreides is also known as the "red hawk", as red is the main colour of his insignia, the hawk.  In some other place in the first book of the Dune cycle, it is remarked that the Harkonnen primary heraldic colour is blue. That's why I picked those. A ll of the Houses also have secondary and flag colours (Atreides for example has green and black for uniforms and flags), but obviously I needed to decide on one to be used as main player colour, to avoid confusion.
        Supplies
        <p><br></p>3)	To clarify, all factions use a total of 12 small Troop cubes, EXCEPT Corrino, which uses 8 small and 4 large, and Fremen, which uses 8 large (only).
        Setup
        <p><br></p>4)	Note that Leader tokens are never placed on the board.  If you are allocated your Leader at Setup, it is placed on your faction card and is available for use in any battle while it is there.
        Ally
        <p><br></p>5)	There are no symbols for the Smuggler or Bene Tleilax factions on the dice.  You may choose ANY one faction symbol to use in order to propose an alliance with one of those two factions.
        <p><br></p>6)	Both you AND the faction currently allied with you (if any) may use your special alliance ability (indicated by the Knot symbol.)
        <p><br></p>7)	To summarize alliance effects:
        a.	Ally Phase – One opportunity to invite any player allowed by your dice roll.  Target player must consent to form alliance (EXCEPT when proposed by Bene Gesserit.)
        b.	Recruit Phase – Allied player may recruit Troop cubes equal to the number of dice showing his faction.  Does not require active player’s consent.  (SPECIAL – Smuggler and Bene Tleilax)
        c.	Ship Troops Phase – Active player may ship to Region(s) containing allied player’s Troops, with allied player’s consent.  Active player may choose to pay to ship allied Troops as if they were his own, with allied player’s consent.
        d.	Move Troops Phase – Allied player may move in the same way as the active player.  Does not require active player’s consent.
        e.	Combat Phase – Active player may use allied player’s Troops in the battle Region as if they were his own.  Does not require allied player’s consent.  Allied player may choose to offer his Leader for the active player’s use.
        Recruit Troops
        <p><br></p>8)	Erratum:  Ignore the second paragraph (“You may only take a Leader…”) entirely, as it no longer applies to any faction as written.  Atreides may have both of its Leaders on its faction card at the same time, and the other factions only have 1 Leader each.
        <p><br></p>9)	There are no symbols for the Smuggler or Bene Tleilax factions on the dice.  During their own turns, Bene Tleilax may choose ANY one faction symbol to use for recruiting Troops and Smugglers pay Spice to recruit Troops instead of using faction symbols.
        <p><br></p>10)	If the Smuggler or Bene Tleilax faction is allied with you, they may only use dice with the faction symbol you chose to propose the alliance for their own recruiting during your turn.
        <p><br></p>11)	If you chose your own faction symbol to ally with the Smuggler or Bene Tleilax faction, you must choose how to share the dice with your symbol for recruiting during your turn.  Each die can only recruit 1 Troop cube, for either your OR your ally.  You must offer your ally at least 1 die.
        Kanly
        <p><br></p>12)	If there is no Thumper left in the supply, you may NOT take one from another player.
        <p><br></p>13)	Under “Poison or Crysknife or Hunter-Seeker”, “token” refers to Troop tokens only.   Leaders may never be removed by Kanly.
        Ship Troops
        <p><br></p>14)	A Harvester located in a Region in the sandstorm does NOT produce 2 extra Spice.  (Regions in the sandstorm are completely “locked down”.)
       <p><br></p> 15)	Note that you ONLY ship Troop cubes to the board (never Leader tokens).
        Move Troops
        <p><br></p>16)	Your (and/or your ally) can ONLY move troops to the target Region you have chosen, which may be a Region with the number you rolled on the Region die, OR the Polar Sink, but never both.
        Combat
        <p><br></p>17)	Note that the active player may use his ally’s Troop cubes in Regions where he is attacking as if they were his own.  This means it is valid to choose to sacrifice all of your ally’s cubes in battle before your own, with or without your ally’s consent.  (But beware diplomatic consequences of such an action.)
        Assets
        <p><br></p>18)	Restructuring is always optional.
       <p><br></p> 19)	You are allowed to restructure the Region you picked as your target Region as long as you control the Region after the Combat step, whether or not combat actually took place.
        <p><br></p>20)	Note that Ornithopters in a non-desert Region will never be removed from the board except through voluntary restructuring.
        Game End
        <p><br></p>21)	Bene Gesserit MAY predict the Guild’s default victory.  (That is, if Bene Gesserit writes down Guild at the start of the game, no one wins within 6 rounds, and the Guild would win its “Ruthless Opportunism” victory, Bene Gesserit wins instead.)
        <p><br></p>22)	Bene Gesserit does NOT win its “Culminating Plans” victory if the faction written down at the start of the game wins while allied with another faction.
        Atreides
        <p><br></p>23)	The effects of “Honourable Duel” are optional.  It is intended to affect only Troops that would normally go to your supply, i.e. Troops you committed, and, in case you lost the battle, other Troops you have in that region.
        Harkonnen
        <p><br></p>24)	Note that the Harkonnen Leader begins the game in the supply, NOT on the Harkonnen faction card as other factions’ Leaders do.
        Bene Tleilax
        <p><br></p>25)	The “Face Dancer” ability may only be used against Troop cubes on the board (never Leaders or other tokens.)
        Corrino
        <p><br></p>26)	If allied with Corrino, the “Chair of the CHOAM” ability does not allow you to save Spice yourself.  Instead, it allows Corrino to give you access to his Spice reserve, i.e. if you need Spice and he consents, you may use from his reserves.  (Note that this is not possible with the Guild.  They are too greedy.)
        Smugglers
        <p><br></p>27)	Erratum:  Add the following ability to the Smugglers’ faction card:  “You may pay 2 Spice to recruit your Leader from the supply.”
